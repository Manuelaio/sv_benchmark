Five of most representative tools for SVs detection was included in our analysis **Manta, Delly, Svaba, ERDS and Lumpy**. Each caller was run with default parameters as report in their main page. 

The input file of caller is [NA12878.alt_bwamem_GRCh38DH.20150706.CEU.illumina_platinum_ped.cram)(http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/illumina_platinum_pedigree/data/CEU/NA12878/alignment/NA12878.alt_bwamem_GRCh38DH.20150706.CEU.illumina_platinum_ped.cram) avaible on 1000 genomes.
